            <h3> Staples Center</h3>
                <p class = "col-sm-12" >
                    This arena is home to many sports teams that reside here in Los Angeles but the 
                    Staples Center is mostly associated with the Lakers. The atmosphere for a Lakers game
                    is unmatched by any other sports team that plays in the Staples Center. The arena is
                    barely more than a decade old, but it already has hosted two NBA All-Star Games and seven
                    NBA Finals series.

            <h3> History</h3>
                <p class = "col-sm-12" >
                    The Staples Center opened on October 17, 1999 with a Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band concert as its inaugural event. The downtown location is very strong, 
                    and there's a ton of restaurants and bars nearby so their is plenty to do after the game.
                    There are also a couple of higher-end hotels just a couple of blocks away. 
                    The arena also is accessible by Los Angeles' light-rail system.

            <h3> What Sets it apart</h3>
                <p class = "col-sm-12" >
                    The most notable feature about Staples Center is the life size
                    Statues outside the arena that honor some of the best who have performed in the Staples Center.  
                    The Panasonic live 4HD scoreboard is among the league's best, it even has an underneath 
                    section that makes it easy for fans sitting courtside to see spectacular replays.
                    Of course, don't forget the people-watching. Hollywood stars famous people around the world 
                    continously attend Lakers games. You never know who could be seated next you.
